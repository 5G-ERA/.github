## 5G-ERA

5G - Enhanced Robot Autonomy

5G-ERA is oriented towards a user-centric paradigm of integrating vertical knowledge into the existing standardised 5G testing framework to improve Quality of Experience (QoE). The project addresses the new challenges of experimental facilities for vertical developers and designers through the following activities: 
1) integrating operational processes of essential autonomous robotic capabilities into Open Source MANO (OSM), ensuring the vertical-specific adaptation of existing experimentation facilities,
2) realising an intent-based networking paradigm by aligning the end-to-end (E2E) resource optimisation with the autonomous operations, ensuring effective policy to be designed
3) Cloud-native Network Services (NSs) on the experimental facilities will create, ensuring robotic applications exploiting NFV/SDN infrastructures efficiently,
4) extending the experimentation facilities into robotic domains through standard APIs under the Robot Operating System (ROS), prompting third-party experimentation activities and engagement from new players.

Robot autonomy is essential for many 5G vertical sectors and can provide multiple benefits in automated mobility, Industry 4.0 and healthcare. 5G technology, on the other hand, has the great potential to enhance robot autonomy. Use cases from four vertical sectors, namely public protection and disaster relief (PPDR), transport, healthcare and manufacturing, will be validated in the project by rapid prototyping NetApp solutions and enhanced vertical experiences on autonomy. These case studies can be regarded as showcases of the potential of 5G and 5G-ERA to accelerate the ongoing convergence of robotics, AI & cloud computing and to unlock the next level of autonomy through 5G-based learning in general
